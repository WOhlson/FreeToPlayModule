"# FreeToPlayModule" 
Prereqs:
- Look in the 'renamed lab' file and read the txt file inside. name a table in phpmyadmin to 'freetoplay' and input the top code.

Minimum goals for this include:
1. Taking a username and password into the website to allow for the creation of an account
2. This account will immediately be put into a tournament bracket against the next account created
3. Add a way for a winner to be determined, after they should move up the bracket
4. The victor moves to the next match / final block
To summarize, we need to take the usernames, display them in a box (think start.gg look), and then have a way for one of them to win (move up).
For the bare minimum, this will all be displayed in one page. The login will disreguard, but store the password and put the username in a match with the other user created.

Extra goals for this: 1 = important, 2 = less important, 3= not important
1 Add dedicated webpage for logging in
2 Add dedicated webpage to hold user info
1 Add way for user class to select tournament going on
1 Add way for tournaments to be named
2 Add tournament customization
2 Allow for dynamic bracket size depending on number of entrants
3 display special winner screen at the end of bracket
